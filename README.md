Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub) Pattern Overview
The Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub) pattern is a messaging pattern where the Publisher sends messages without knowing who the Subscribers are. Subscribers, in turn, listen for messages on a particular channel and respond accordingly. This allows for loose coupling between the components, meaning the sender (Publisher) does not need to know the specifics of the receivers (Subscribers).

Key Concepts in Pub/Sub:
Publisher:

The publisher sends messages or events to a channel. It doesn't know who will receive the messages. Multiple publishers can push messages to a channel.
Subscriber:

The subscriber listens to a specific channel and reacts to messages when they arrive. Multiple subscribers can listen to the same channel, and they will all receive the message sent by the publisher.
Channel:

Channels are the mediums through which messages are sent. A channel can be thought of as a topic or subject, and it is used for message delivery. Publishers push messages to a channel, and subscribers receive messages from the channel.
Message:

A message is the data or event that the publisher sends to the channel. Subscribers receive and process these messages


Singleton Pattern in Pub/Sub
In the context of Pub/Sub, the Singleton Pattern ensures that there is only one instance of the Pub/Sub Manager across the system, which manages all the channels and subscriptions. This is useful for centralized management, where you don't want multiple instances of the Pub/Sub system running, which could lead to conflicts or inefficiency.

How the Singleton Pattern Works:
Unique Instance: The Singleton ensures that only one instance of the Pub/Sub system exists, and this instance is shared across the application.
Centralized Control: The singleton instance handles the interaction with Redis and ensures that message publishing and subscription are streamlined.
Thread Safety: The Singleton ensures thread-safe operations by managing multiple publisher/subscriber connections in a controlled environment.


Redis Pub/Sub
Redis is a powerful, open-source, in-memory data structure store that can be used as a Pub/Sub message broker. Redis provides a built-in publish/subscribe feature that allows services or components of a system to communicate asynchronously.

How Redis Implements Pub/Sub:
Publisher: The publisher sends messages to a Redis channel using the PUBLISH command. This can be done by any service or application component.

Subscriber: The subscriber listens to one or more channels using the SUBSCRIBE command. When a message is published to the channel, Redis pushes the message to all subscribers of that channel.

Channels: Redis channels are similar to topics. Each message published to a channel is delivered to all clients subscribed to that channel. Redis handles the routing of the messages to the subscribers automatically.

Redis Pub/Sub Process:
Subscription: A client (service) subscribes to one or more channels using the SUBSCRIBE command. The client then waits for messages on these channels.

Message Publishing: Another client publishes a message to a channel using the PUBLISH command. Redis delivers this message to all subscribers of the channel.

Message Reception: Subscribers receive the message in real time, which allows them to take immediate actions or process the data.

Redis Pub/Sub Commands:
PUBLISH channel message: Sends a message to a channel.
SUBSCRIBE channel: Subscribes to one or more channels to receive messages.
UNSUBSCRIBE channel: Unsubscribes from one or more channels.
PSUBSCRIBE pattern: Subscribes to channels that match a pattern.
PUNSUBSCRIBE pattern: Unsubscribes from channels matching a pattern.
